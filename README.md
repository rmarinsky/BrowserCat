# 🐈 BrowserCat

**macOS menu bar browser picker** — choose which browser, profile, or app opens every link with one click or hotkey.

Stop copy-pasting URLs between browsers. Stop launching the wrong profile. BrowserCat gives you instant control over where every link opens.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Multiple Browser Profiles
**Problem:** You have Chrome Personal, Chrome Work, and constantly open links in the wrong profile.
**Solution:** BrowserCat shows all profiles in the picker. One click → right profile, every time.

```
Click a link → Picker appears → Choose "Chrome (Work)" → Done
```

### 2️⃣ Privacy-First Browsing
**Problem:** Opening banking links, medical results, or private searches requires manually launching incognito mode.
**Solution:** Hold `Option/Shift` or set a URL rule to auto-open in private mode.

```
Click banking URL → Auto-opens in Safari Private
Or: Option + Hotkey → Any browser in incognito
```

### 3️⃣ Native App Routing
**Problem:** Slack/Figma/Zoom links open in browser instead of the native app.
**Solution:** BrowserCat detects matching apps and prioritizes them in the picker.

```
slack.com/archives/... → Opens in Slack.app (not browser)
figma.com/file/... → Opens in Figma.app
zoom.us/j/... → Opens in Zoom.app
```

### 4️⃣ URL-Based Automation
**Problem:** GitHub links should always open in Arc, Jira in Chrome Work, YouTube in Safari.
**Solution:** Set URL rules by host, substring, or regex.

```
github.com/* → Arc Browser
*.atlassian.net/* → Chrome (Work Profile)
youtube.com/* → Safari
```

### 5️⃣ Testing Across Browsers
**Problem:** QA/Dev workflow requires checking the same URL in 5+ browsers.
**Solution:** Keyboard hotkeys let you open the same link instantly in any browser.

```
1. Copy URL
2. Press ⌘+1 → Opens in Chrome
3. Press ⌘+2 → Opens in Firefox
4. Press ⌘+3 → Opens in Safari
(All from the same clipboard URL)
```

### 6️⃣ Context-Aware Link Opening
**Problem:** Personal emails → Personal browser. Work docs → Work browser. Manual switching is tedious.
**Solution:** Set domain-based rules and profiles to auto-route.

```
mail.google.com → Chrome Personal
docs.google.com/a/company.com → Chrome Work
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does BrowserCat collect any data?**
A: No. Zero analytics, zero telemetry, zero network calls. Fully offline.

**Q: Why does the picker appear in the wrong position?**
A: The picker tries to center near the cursor. If it's off-screen, it auto-adjusts. Check Settings → Advanced to tweak behavior.

**Q: Can I disable the picker and use only hotkeys?**
A: Not yet, but this is planned. For now, set hotkeys and press them immediately.

**Q: Does this work with Raycast/Alfred URL handlers?**
A: Yes, if they trigger the system default browser, BrowserCat will intercept.

**Q: How do I uninstall?**
A: Drag BrowserCat from Applications to Trash, then reset your default browser in System Settings.
